# youtube downloader

Little commandline I use on Windows for downloading videos from numerous sites that youtube_dl support (like Youtube.com, etc).

Also compiled a .exe with pyinstaller if anyone's interested.

It reads your clipboard upon launch so you can just ctrl+c url then double click a shortcut of this to quickly start download...
